    <h2 id="h1">Earth-Moon system</h2>
    <p id="p1">The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It orbits at an average distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi), about 30 times the diameter of Earth. Tidal forces between Earth and the Moon have over time synchronized the Moon's orbital period (lunar month) with its rotation period (lunar day) at 29.5 Earth days, causing the same side of the Moon to always face Earth. The Moon's gravitational pull and to a lesser extent, the Sun's are the main drivers of Earth's tides.The Earth and the Moon form the Earth-Moon satellite system with a shared center of mass, or barycenter. This barycenter is 1,700 km (1,100 mi) (about a quarter of Earth's radius) beneath the Earth's surface.The Moon's orbit is slightly elliptical, with an orbital eccentricity of 0.055.The semi-major axis of the geocentric lunar orbit, called the lunar distance, is approximately 400,000 km (250,000 miles or 1.28 light-seconds), comparable to going around Earth 9.5 times.</p> 
    <h2 id="h2">Natural history</h2>
    <p id="p2">The Moon formed around 50 million years after the origin of the Solar System.Historically, several formation mechanisms have been proposed,[39] but none satisfactorily explains the features of the Earth Moon system. A fission of the Moon from Earth's crust through centrifugal force[40] would require too great an initial rotation rate of Earth.[41] Gravitational capture of a pre-formed Moon[42] depends on an unfeasibly extended atmosphere of Earth to dissipate the energy of the passing Moon.[41] A co-formation of Earth and the Moon together in the primordial accretion disk does not explain the depletion of metals in the Moon.None of these hypotheses can account for the high angular momentum of the Earth Moon system.The prevailing theory is that the Earth Moon system formed after a giant impact of a Mars-sized body (named Theia) with the proto-Earth. The oblique impact blasted material into orbit about the Earth and the material accreted and formed the Moon[44][45] just beyond the Earth's Roche limit of ~2.56 RðŸœ¨.</p>
